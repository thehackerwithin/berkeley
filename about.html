      <b>What: </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      This is a weekly meeting for sharing skills and best practices for 
      scientific computation. In the Fall 2013 semester at UC Berkeley a small group of nuclear 
      engineers had a couple such meetings. In spring semester of 2014, this 
      grew into a more structured set of skill sharing sessions for scientific 
      software development (testing, data management, version control, literate 
      programming etc. ) The goal will be to learn cool skills and incorporate 
      these practices into our workflows. This meeting would be a great venue 
      for introducing new libraries, showing off useful features of a neutronics 
      code you're using, or bringing up a computational problem you're having.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Where: </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      2150 Shattuck, Suite 230
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Who:</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Anyone interested in software development best practices is welcome to 
      come to our meetings. There will likely be a particular emphasis on 
      computational nuclear engineering, and neutronics analysis best practices. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>When:</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Wednesdays at 4pm. The meeting should last one to two hours. See the 
      <a href="http://bit.ly/1cqFKuh">calendar</a> for the topic for this week.
      To keep up with meetings, you may want to  
      <a 
        href="https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/ucb-hacker-within@lists.berkeley.edu">sign 
        up for the listhost</a>.
      </p>


      <p>
      <b>How:</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Participating is really easy. 
      <b>First,</b> you'll show up. <b>Second,</b> you'll watch a short 
      discussion of some computational topic. To volunteer to give this talk, 
      just let the listhost know by email at <a 
        href="mailto:ucb-hacker-within@lists.berkeley.edu">ucb-hacker-within@lists.berkeley.edu</a>. 
      <b>Next,</b> there will be some time devoted to current updates or questions you 
      and other attendees have about your own computational work. 
      <b>Finally,</b> there 
      will be a time for a couple of Lightning Talks, which are 5-10 minute 
      blasts of information about a particular topic or question of interest to 
      the group.  
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Why: </b>
      </p>
      <p>
      The tenets of scientiﬁc endeavor (e.g., data control, reproducibility, 
      comprehensive documentation, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail 
      to make use of current development tools such as unit testing, version 
      control, automated documentation, and others.</p>
      <p>
      To avoid these pitfalls, this weekly meeting exists for sharing skills and best practices for 
      computational scientific applications. This group is modeled after The 
      Hacker Within, which  began as a student organization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and 
      is now reborn as a collection of such chapters around the world. Each of 
      the chapters convenes a community of scientists, at all levels of their 
      education and training, to share their knowledge and best practices in 
      using computing to accomplish their work.</p>
