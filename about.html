      <b>What: </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      This will be a weekly meeting for sharing skills and best practices for 
      computational nuclear engineering applications. This semester, we had a 
      couple such meetings. In spring semester I would like to share a number of 
      skills for scientific software development (testing, data management, 
      version control, literate programming etc. ) and to ask the rest of you to 
      share the skills you have as well. The goal will be to incorporate these 
      practices into our workflows. This would be a great venue for introducing 
      new libraries, showing off useful features of a neutronics code you're 
      using, or bringing up a computational problem you're having.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Where: </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      2150 Shattuck, Suite 230
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Who:</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Anyone interested in software development best practices is welcome to 
      come to our meetings. There will likely be a particular emphasis on 
      computational nuclear engineering, and neutronics analysis best practices. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>When:</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Wednesdays at 4pm. The meeting should last one to two hours. See the 
      <a href="http://bit.ly/1cqFKuh">calendar</a> for the topic for this week.
      </p>


      <p>
      <b>How:</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Participating is really easy. 
      <b>First,</b> you'll show up. <b>Second,</b> you'll watch a short 
      discussion of some computational topic. To volunteer to give this talk, 
      just let katy know <a href="mailto:katyhuff@gmail.com">by email</a>. 
      <b>Next,</b> there will be some time devoted to current updates or questions you 
      and other attendees have about your own computational work. 
      <b>Finally,</b> there 
      will be a time for a couple of Lightning Talks, which are 5-10 minute 
      blasts of information about a particular topic or question of interest to 
      the group.
