To see the full list of commands, press `H` while in Command Mode. This will also show you the (system-specific) keyboard shortcuts for Edit Mode. If you remember only one keyboard command in Jupyter, make it `Esc, H`.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you're done with a Jupyter notebook, close it and shut off the kernel by clicking, in the toolbar, `File > Close and Halt`. If you just want to close the tab, but preserve all the values you've computed, just close the tab. You'll be able to reopen the notebook from the file browser. Note that shutting off the kernel won't delete anything that's in the outputs (e.g. the printed `welcome to jupyter!` above). We'll talk about this more in `01`."
