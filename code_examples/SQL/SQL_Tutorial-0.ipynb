    "# Creating tables\n",
    "A relational database or SQL database is a tabular structure consisting of rows of data with columns of fields. The [data definition language or DDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language) used to create the table is the same language used to query it, called [SQL or Structured Query Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although [the basic SQL commands](https://sqlite.org/lang.html) are nearly the same for [other relational databases](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/sql.html), the data types may be different. [SQLite only has 5 datatypes](https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html): `NULL`, `INTEGER`, `REAL`, `TEXT`, `BLOB`. For [boolean, use integer zero for false, and one for true](https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html#boolean_datatype). For [dates and times use text and ISO8601](https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html#date_and_time_datatype), _e.g._: `\"2018-02-21T17:05-0800\"`. By comparison, [PostgreSQL has too many to list here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/datatype.html) including booleans, date, time, arrays, JSON, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `CREATE`\n",
    "The [basic SQL command to create a table](https://sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html) is\n",
    "\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE <table_name> (<field_name> <TYPE> <CONSTRAINTS>, <field_name> <TYPE> <CONSTRAINTS>, <CONSTRAINTS>, ...);\n",
    "\n",
    "Some languages enforce the semicolon, some don't. The syntax is nearly the same for [other relational databases](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/ddl-basics.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints, Defaults, and Options\n",
    "Constraints are optional and set conditions, limitations, or options for columns and the table. The most common constraints are: `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`, `DEFAULT`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `REFERENCES`, etc. The syntax is nearly the same for [other relational databases](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/ddl-constraints.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `PRIMARY KEY`\n",
    "The most important of these is `PRIMARY KEY` which is equivalent to `UNIQUE NOT NULL`. A [primary key](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-PRIMARY-KEYS) is a unique references that identifies each record in the table. Although it is not required, every table should have a primary key. Only one primary key is allowed, and it can be constructed from multiple columns, `PRIMARY KEY (<field_A>, <field_B)`, to create a unique together, non-null identifier. [In SQLite, if missing then a integer primary key named, `rowid`, is created by default](https://sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#rowid). Also in SQLite, any integer primary key is automatically incremented, so [the _AUTOINCREMENT_ command is usually **not** needed](https://sqlite.org/autoinc.html). [In PostgreSQL the `SERIAL` command is used](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-SERIAL) to create a corresponding [sequence](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/functions-sequence.html) for the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice\n",
    "The other constraints and options are also important, but we'll discover those as we learn. Let's create some simple databases with fictitious data to practice. Imagine you are testing several different materials with different properties $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ under different stresses like different temperatures and  light intensity and changing thickness. How would you organize this data? Take a moment to design a schema or structure for your data. The schema consists of the column names and data types and the column and table constraints."

    "1. You can read the SQLite and PostgreSQL manuals or use [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/SQL) to teach yourself SQL. It's not rocket science. I was a mechanical engineer, and I learned it.\n",
    "2. The basics of making a table, inserting data, and conducting queries.\n",
    "3. How to interact programmatically with a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's still so much to learn! Hopefully you will continue on your own and try some of these intereting topics.\n",
    "1. Use what you've learned on a more advanced database management system like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MS SQL Server.\n",
    "2. Use an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) like Django or SQLAlchemy to simplify your workflow, by creating and manipulating data in native Python.\n",
    "3. Explore a NoSQL database like Cassandra or MongoDB and see if the flexible structure and large scale cluster computing allow you to explore big data with tools like [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) and [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/).\n",
