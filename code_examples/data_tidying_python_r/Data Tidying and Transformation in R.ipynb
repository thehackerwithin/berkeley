    "# Data Tidying and Transformation in R\n",

    "\n",
    "### The goal\n",
    "Data tidying is a necessary first step for data analysis - it's the process of taking your messily formatted data (missing values, unwieldy coding/organization, etc.) and literally tidying it up so it can be easily used for downstream analyses. To quote Hadley Wickham, \"Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure:\n",
    "each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit\n",
    "is a table.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These data are actually pretty tidy, so we're going to be focusing on cleaning and manipulation, but these manipulations will give you some idea of how to tidy untidy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The datasets\n",
    "We are going to be using the data from the R package [`nycflights13`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf). There are five datasets corresponding to flights departing NYC in 2013. We will load directly into R from the library, but the repository also includes CSV files we created for the purposes of the Python demo and can also be used to load the data into our R session.\n",
