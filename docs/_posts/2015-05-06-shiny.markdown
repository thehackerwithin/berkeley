Github repo with some example code: [https://github.com/karthik/shiny](https://github.com/karthik/shiny)
The most up to date resource on Shiny: [http://shiny.rstudio.com/](http://shiny.rstudio.com)
Also see some amazing cheatsheets here: [http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets)

- server.R holds the behind the scenes info
- ui.R holds the interface

Best way to learn: Try building an app. 
Best resource: cheatsheets rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets


```R
## ui.R
shinyUI( fluidPage(
    titlePanel("This is a shiny app"),
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            selectInput("x", "x variable", names(iris))
            selectInput("y", "y variable", names(iris), names(iris)[[2]])
            ),
        mainPanel()
        
        )
    ))

```



```R
## server.R
## any code that runs once on each server
## put that code *before* the shinyServer() call
library(ggplot2)

shinyServer(function(input, output){
    output$gg <-
    })

```
