## Free and Open Source Software, FOSS or OSS
There are many definitions of "open source software" and even different names like ["free and open source software"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

A Wikipedia post on [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) says the following:
>Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright
>holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software
>may be developed in a collaborative public manner. According to scientists who studied it, open-source software is a prominent
>example of open collaboration.[2] The term is often written without a hyphen as "open source software".

GitHub's [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/) by Nadia Eghbal answers the question: [What does “open source” mean?](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/#what-does-open-source-mean) in a section called: [Starting an Open Source Project](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/).
>When a project is open source, that means anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute your
>project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source license.

For more rigor check out the the [Open Source Initiative (OSI) definition](https://opensource.org/osd), but the bottom line is that open
source code is _free_, as in **free beer**.

## The importance of contributing to open source
Why do people create open source software? [GitHub's open source guide says, "There are many reasons"](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/#why-do-people-open-source-their-work):
> * Collaboration: "Open source projects can accept changes from anybody in the world."
> * Adoption: "Open source projects can be used by anyone for nearly any purpose. People can even use it to build other things."
> * Transparency: "Anyone can inspect an open source project for errors or inconsistencies."

Wikipedia discusses the ["open source development model: advangtages and disadvantages"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software#Advantages_and_disadvantages) (emphasis mine):
> * "Open source software is usually easier to obtain than proprietary software, often resulting in **increased use**."
> * "Open source development offers the potential for a **more flexible technology and quicker innovation**."

The [OSI](https://opensource.org/) lists their reasons too (emphasis mine):
> * Developers: "Open source projects provide tremendous opportunities for developers to **share and learn through collaboration**."
> * Business: "... enterprises have realized the promise of open source: **higher quality, greater reliability, more flexibility, lower cost** ..."
> * Non-Profit: "... open source ethos of contribution & community helps make life for NPO & NGO staffers easier"
> * Education: ""
> * Government: ""
