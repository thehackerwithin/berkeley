## Free and Open Source Software, FOSS or OSS
There are many definitions of "open source software" and even different names like ["free and open source software"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).
Wikipedia post on [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) says:
>Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright
>holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software
>may be developed in a collaborative public manner. According to scientists who studied it, open-source software is a prominent
>example of open collaboration.[2] The term is often written without a hyphen as "open source software".

GitHub's [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/#what-does-open-source-mean) by Nadia Eghbal says:
>What does “open source” mean? When a project is open source, that means anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute your
>project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source license.

For more rigor check out the the [Open Source Initiative definition](https://opensource.org/osd). The bottom line is that open
source code is free, as in free beer.
