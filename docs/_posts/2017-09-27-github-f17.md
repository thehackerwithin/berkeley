## Free and Open Source Software, FOSS or OSS
There are many definitions of "open source software" and even different names like ["free and open source software"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

A Wikipedia post on [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) says the following:
>Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright
>holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software
>may be developed in a collaborative public manner. According to scientists who studied it, open-source software is a prominent
>example of open collaboration.[2] The term is often written without a hyphen as "open source software".

GitHub's [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/) by Nadia Eghbal answers the question: [What does “open source” mean?](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/#what-does-open-source-mean) in a section called: [Starting an Open Source Project](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/).
>When a project is open source, that means anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute your
>project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source license.

For more rigor check out the the [Open Source Initiative (OSI) definition](https://opensource.org/osd), but the bottom line is that open
source code is _free_, as in **free beer**.

## The importance of contributing to open source
Why do people create open source software? [GitHub's open source guide says, "There are many reasons"](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/#why-do-people-open-source-their-work):
> * Collaboration: "Open source projects can accept changes from anybody in the world."
> * Adoption: "Open source projects can be used by anyone for nearly any purpose. People can even use it to build other things."
> * Transparency: "Anyone can inspect an open source project for errors or inconsistencies."

Wikipedia discusses the ["open source development model: advangtages and disadvantages"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software#Advantages_and_disadvantages) (emphasis mine):
> * "Open source software is usually easier to obtain than proprietary software, often resulting in **increased use**."
> * "Open source development offers the potential for a **more flexible technology and quicker innovation**."

The [OSI](https://opensource.org/) lists their reasons too (emphasis mine):
> * Developers: "Open source projects provide tremendous opportunities for developers to **share and learn through collaboration**."
> * Business: "... enterprises have realized the promise of open source: **higher quality, greater reliability, more flexibility, lower cost** ..."
> * Non-Profit: "... open source ethos of contribution & community helps make life for NPO & NGO staffers easier"

## Ways to contribute
There are many ways to find and contribute to open source. Here are a few ...

1. [Open Source Fridays by GitHub](https://opensourcefriday.com/)
2. [GitHub's Open Source Guide by Nadia Eghbal](https://opensource.guide/)
3. [Hacktoberfest sponsored by Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
4. [GitHub](https://github.com/open-source)

## Using GitHub for Open Source projects
GitHub is an ideal tool for open source projects for many reasons. It's free for open source projects. The issue, pull request and review tools make contributing to open source much easier. And other tools like a wiki, issue or pull request templates, and automatic detection of licenses, contribution guidelines, and codes of conduct are also very useful.

### The license
Whether you are using, creating or contributing to open source, it's useful to have a basic understanding of licenses. [According to OSI there at least 9 common licenses.](https://opensource.org/licenses) GitHub created [choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/) to help users choose and create a license. There are even [licenses for works of art and prose by Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) for use in blogs and other online creations that aren't necessarily computer code.

### Code of Conduct and Contribution Guidelines
You want to read these and follow them.

### Issues
One of the easiest ways to contribute to open source is to create an issue. Issues can be technical, code-related or an improvement to the documentation. There is no issue too big or too small, and never any dumb questions, only dumb answers. However try to empathize with the other users and maintainers when reporting issues. They may be overwhelmed by a deluge of issues, and they are typically volunteering their precious free time. So a little preparation or ground work before submitting an issue will go a long way to getting the issue resolved.

1. Try to solve the issue yourselve. Spend a reasonable amount of time on this to show that you've done your research.

    * Check if the open source project has a [Google group](https://groups.google.com/) or a Slack or IRC channel and
       search for common questions or issues you have. Ask for help from the forum.
    * Ditto for [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

2. If there are submission guidelines or an issue template, read and follow it very carefully, complete all sections as thoroughly
   as possible.

    * Include in your issue somethign that approaches a [minimum complete verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) of your issue.
    * It should go without saying, but be polite, respectful and constructive. [Assume Good Faith](https://opensource.org/node/877)

3. Scratch your own itch. Follow your issue with a [pull request](#pull-requests).

### Pull Requests
[Pull requests (PR's)](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) are one of the most useful keys to contributing to open source. I wrote a [blog post called winning workflow](http://poquitopicante.blogspot.com/2016/10/winning-workflow.html) about how we use PR's in my team to collaborate. With a few exceptions, PR's are how most open source projects receive contributions.

A PR is not a Git feature; a PR is a feature of GitHub and other online hosted repositories. A PR is defined by GitHub as follows:

>Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can
>discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the
>repository.
