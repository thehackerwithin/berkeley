This session will cover some useful R functions, with a focus on installing packages from various sources and managing environments. I'll also present some customizations to RStudio that I've found helpful in my work.

A minimal background in R is recommended: be familiar with basic arithmetic and have previously installed a package in R.

Please make sure you have installed [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
