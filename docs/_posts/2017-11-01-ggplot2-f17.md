In this session you will learn how to build impressive ggplot2 figures. To help along the way, I will teach you the grammar of graphics, the basic plot types available in ggplot2, and a plethora of ways to customize your figures (including, time permitting, making your own ggplot theme).

The jupyter notebook containing the materials for this session can be found here: https://github.com/rlbarter/ggplot2-thw.
