## Goals of the workshop

In this session, I will give a quick overview of the basic machine learning and an introduction of [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/). The goals are:

* Understand the basics of Machine Learning, we will cover the classification and regression in this session. 

* Get familiar with the syntax of scikit-learn

After the workshop, you should be able to use popular models in your problems.
