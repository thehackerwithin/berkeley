** RSVP REQUIRED **

There will be no meeting of The Hacker Within at Berkeley on March 7th. But if you'd like to hang out with some likeminded people interested in open source, open data, open knowledge, and open everything, Wednesday evening, then head to San Francisco for the SF Open Drinks meetup. March 7th from 5:30-7:30pm at the Wikimedia Foundation's headquarters at Montgomery St BART (120 Kearny Street, Suite 1600). Due to security of the building, you **must** [RSVP on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/join-us-for-open-drinks-wikimedia-on-march-7-tickets-43690595748) beforehand and bring an ID. See more info and details there.
