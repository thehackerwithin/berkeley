      The Hacker Within will explore the following tentative set of topics in
      Spring 2015. In addition to these topics, Lightning Talks are welcome at the
      end of every session, so please don't hesitate to bring some tidbit to share.
      Also, if you would like to contribute to a topic, contact the volunteer in
      charge of that topic to see if they would like to collaborate.
